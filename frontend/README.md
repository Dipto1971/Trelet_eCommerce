## Redux Architecture

Redux is used for managing the state of the application. Actions, reducers, and the store are organized as follows:

- **Actions**: Define the actions that can be dispatched.
- **Reducers**: Specify how the state changes in response to dispatched actions.
- **Store**: Holds the application state.

## Bootstrap Integration

Bootstrap is used for styling to ensure a consistent and visually appealing design. The Bootstrap grid system and components are employed for responsive layout and UI elements.

## Usage

Describe how users can interact with the application and any additional configuration they may need.
